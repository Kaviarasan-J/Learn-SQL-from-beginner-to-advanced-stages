## 📝 Introduction

# 

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language to interact with relational databases. With SQL, you can:

*   🔍 Retrieve specific data from large datasets
    
*   ✍️ Insert, update, and delete records
    
*   📊 Perform calculations and aggregations
    
*   🔗 Analyze relationships across multiple tables
    

Databases we’ll practice on: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite (feel free to pick your favorite).

* * *

## 💻 Step 1: Setting Up Your SQL Environment

# 

1.  Install SQL Engine:
    
    *   MySQL: Download MySQL
        
    *   PostgreSQL: [Download PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   SQLite: Download SQLite
        
2.  Connect to the Database:
    

sql

Copy code

`-- Connect to MySQL mysql -u root -p`

3.  Create a Sample Database:
    

sql

Copy code

`CREATE DATABASE practice_sql; USE practice_sql;`

4.  Create a Sample Table:
    

sql

Copy code

`CREATE TABLE employees (     id INT PRIMARY KEY,     first_name VARCHAR(50),     last_name VARCHAR(50),     department VARCHAR(50),     salary DECIMAL(10,2),     hire_date DATE );`

* * *

## 🔍 Step 2: Basic SQL Queries

# 

SELECT Statement: Retrieve Data

sql

Copy code

`SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees;`

✅ Explanation: Gets the first and last names of all employees.

SELECT with DISTINCT

sql

Copy code

`SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;`

✅ Explanation: Lists unique departments.

* * *

## 🎯 Step 3: Filtering & Sorting Data

# 

WHERE Clause: Filter Rows

sql

Copy code

`SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';`

Comparison Operators: `=, <>, >, <, >=, <=`  
Logical Operators: `AND, OR, NOT`

ORDER BY: Sort Data

sql

Copy code

`SELECT first_name, salary FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;`

✅ Explanation: Sorts employees by salary, highest first.

* * *

## 🧮 Step 4: Aggregate Functions & Grouping

# 

Aggregate Functions:

*   `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`
    

Example: Count Employees per Department

sql

Copy code

`SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees FROM employees GROUP BY department;`

HAVING Clause: Filter groups

sql

Copy code

`SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;`

* * *

## 🔗 Step 5: Joins & Relationships

# 

INNER JOIN: Combine Tables with Matching Data

sql

Copy code

`SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name FROM employees e INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department = d.department_name;`

LEFT JOIN: Include all rows from the left table

sql

Copy code

`SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name FROM employees e LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department = d.department_name;`

Tip: Use aliases (`e`, `d`) for readability.

* * *

## 🧩 Step 6: Subqueries & Nested Queries

# 

Subquery Example:

sql

Copy code

`SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE department IN (     SELECT department_name     FROM departments     WHERE location = 'New York' );`

✅ Explanation: Finds employees in departments located in New York.

* * *

## ⚡ Step 7: Advanced SQL Concepts

# 

*   Indexes: Speed up queries on large tables.
    
*   Views: Virtual tables to simplify complex queries.
    
*   Stored Procedures: Precompiled SQL logic for reuse.
    
*   Triggers: Automate actions on data changes.
    
*   Window Functions: Analyze data across rows without grouping.
    

* * *

## 🧪 Step 8: Practice Exercises

# 

1.  Retrieve all employees hired in the last 2 years.
    
2.  Find the top 3 highest-paid employees.
    
3.  List departments with total salary > 100,000.
    
4.  Join employees with projects table to show project assignments.
    
5.  Create a view showing employees and their department average salary.

## 📌 Appendix: SQL Tips & Tricks

# 

| Action | SQL Command |
| --- | --- |
| List all tables | SHOW TABLES; |
| Describe table structure | DESCRIBE employees; |
| Delete table | DROP TABLE table_name; |
| Update data | UPDATE employees SET salary = 60000 WHERE id = 1; |
| Delete data | DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1; |
